# Introduction

This project introduces a Car Price Analysis Dashboard, an interactive tool designed to analyze and visualize car pricing trends in South Africa. Using a dataset that includes car brands, models, descriptions, prices, and engine sizes, the dashboard provides valuable insights into pricing patterns and market trends.

The tool is developed using Streamlit, a Python-based framework for building interactive web applications, and focuses on making data exploration easy and accessible for both consumers and businesses.

# Importance of the Project

1. For Consumers
Helps buyers identify car models that offer the best value for their budget.
Provides insights into pricing trends across different brands and models.
2. For Sellers
Assists dealerships and sellers in optimizing pricing strategies.
Highlights factors such as engine size and brand reputation that influence car pricing.
3. For Market Analysis
Delivers an overview of the car market in South Africa.
Supports data-driven decision-making for automotive stakeholders, including manufacturers and marketers.

# Dashboard Features
